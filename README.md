## Overview

The goal of this project is to create accurate classifiers for different animal subspecies based on image data. We utilize deep learning techniques and pre-trained models like ResNet50, MobileNetV3, and DenseNet121 for efficient training.

## Models

The following models are available in this project:

- **ResNet50**: A deep residual network model for image classification.
- **MobileNetV3**: A lightweight model optimized for mobile and edge devices.
- **DenseNet121**: A densely connected convolutional network for efficient feature reuse.

### Accessing the Models

The models are hosted on Google Drive. You can download them from the following folder:

[**Animal Subspecies Classification Models**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1amG7RqxqujTs5DDMLn1nexEp-KSVoR4U?usp=sharing)

Download the desired model file and follow the usage instructions to integrate it into your own classification pipeline.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alys-source14/poai-image-classification.git
   cd animal_subspecies_classification
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment**
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can create one using the following commands:
   
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the necessary Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Download the Model:**
   Download the model of your choice from the Google Drive folder linked above.

2. **Run the Classification Script:**
   Once the model is downloaded, use the following script to classify an image:

   ```bash
   python classify_image.py --model <path_to_downloaded_model> --image <path_to_image>
   ```
   Replace `<path_to_downloaded_model>` with the path to your downloaded model file and `<path_to_image>` with the path to the image you want to classify.
